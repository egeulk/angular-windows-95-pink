    Thank you for your interest in our newest human model. While it may not be able to distinguishable from the any other human models we've made but one model in particular has something to say about it! </p>
<p>"I remember being in highschool, seeing her playing with that retarded Paper fortune teller-or whatever the fuck they call it. She looked very charming, being entertained by a boring thing like that. It was all over for me when I started to think she looked not bad with her bun. If they weren't defending her smile with an army, it was the Lord's fault. She deserved to be happy - and it was a nice scenery too."</p>
<p>Well that's weird, sure, our model deserves to be happy I guess? Any other comments uh Mr. 07/xM5U8nhIum1CSgivApX1cq?</p><br>
<p>"You see, she's very smart and I want to emphasize that a lot. She's a graduate of one of the top medical schools of Turkey and has succesfully passed all of her classes so far.
    I'm aware there're many people in this planet and most of us are insignificant but I think I could have made her happy. This guy, 07/xM5... loves you and wishes the best for you. 
    And out of all the insignificant people that have loved you or will love you, this is my unique gift to you."</p>
    <p>Well you heard it folks, just like how a food is not superior to each other, same can be said for our models.
        The whole "smartest", "most beatiful" are just silly terms when you accept people have hundreds of varying qualities, insured to provide unique experiences. Still, <p class="talking">I believe you're objectively amazing. If you lose faith in your self, believe in me who believes in you.</p>
